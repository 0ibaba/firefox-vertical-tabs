* Firefox Vertical Tabs
Vertical tabs for Firefox, inspired by Edge.

Works with Light theme, Dark theme, and System theme (auto dark mode).
There are some minor glitches with Alpenglow, but they should be easy to fix.

** Compatibility
I have only tested this for Linux and macOS. There might be some bugs on Windows because the window decorations look different.
I can't test this because I don't have a Windows computer, but if you find any bugs and know how to fix it, feel free to submit a PR.

** How to install
- Go to =about:config=, search for ~toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets~ and set it to ~true~.
- Add the ~userChrome.css~ to your Firefox profile.
- Install [[https://framagit.org/ariasuni/tabcenter-reborn/-/wikis/home][Tab Center Reborn]] extension.
- Go to =about:addons=, select /Tab Center Reborn/, go to /Preferences/ and set:
  + /Animations/: on.
  + /Use current browser theme/: on, if you want to use dark mode.
  + /Compact Mode/: either "Dynamic" or "Enabled". It works with "Disabled" too but looks nicer with only favicons.
  + /Favicon-only pinned tabs/: off.
  + Activate /Custom Stylesheet/ and paste the contents of ~tabCenterReborn.css~ into the text area, and click "Save CSS".
- Restart Firefox.
